[Alien9.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20020328032158/http://www.alien9.org/) The inspiration of this repository, though unfortunately some of the links here are gone (including the website itself, so that's why I'm using the Internet Archive for this one).
["Par√°sito" by Jeshua Morbus](https://trazosdejeshua.wordpress.com/category/parasito/) The writer here really made me feel immersed into the story. It's the longest A9 fanfic in general (reaching 17 chapters). I hope you guys enjoy reading it.
[Alien 9 Crossrealms](https://alien9.crossrealms.net/) A good website that contains all A9-related things; from fanfics, fan-arts, to even keeping a well-known essay about the series.
[Setetresetetres](https://setetresetetres.neocities.org/) A website made by my good friend, gov. It doesn't have much content there yet, but be patient, he will deliver.
