# ALIEN9-NET
This is a directory where I link to websites that are Alien 9 fansites, or have Alien 9 related content in them.
So, what makes this one important? Well, so us Alien 9 fans can have an easy method to show our websites to each other without a hassle using search engines and to connect with each other easily. I hope this repository can help all A9 fans around the globe; from the present and future.

1.) [Alien9.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20020328032158/http://www.alien9.org/) The inspiration of this directory, though unfortunately some of the links here are gone (including the website itself, so that's why I'm using the Internet Archive for this one).

2.) ["Par√°sito" by Jeshua Morbus](https://trazosdejeshua.wordpress.com/category/parasito/) The writer here really made me feel immersed into the story (though I am still at chapter 3, embarassingly..). It's the longest A9 fanfic in general (reaching 17 chapters). I hope you guys enjoy reading it.

3.) [Alien 9 Crossrealms](https://alien9.crossrealms.net/) A good website that contains all A9-related things; from fanfics, fan-arts, to even keeping a well-known essay about the series.

4.) [Setetresetetres](https://setetresetetres.neocities.org/) A website made by my good friend, gov. It doesn't have much content there yet, but be patient, he will deliver.

5.) [Momo](http://cf.vow.co.jp/momo/a9/A9_ent.html) An artist who was there during A9's early fanbase period. Enjoy some of his arts here.
